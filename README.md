a colourgame~

much thanks to [Anthony Luo](https://github.com/antholuo) for helping me too many times.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install VLC 64-bit. You can do so by clicking [here](https://get.videolan.org/vlc/3.0.16/win64/vlc-3.0.16-win64.exe).
2. Clone the entire repository wherever you would like. A link to the top level of the repository can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/Chrisytz/I-Love-Hue-python-ver).
    - it is important that you clone the entire repository. Dependencies have not been packaged with the exe.
3. Find `main.exe`, and double-click to run on windows.
4. If windows security blocks you from playing the game click 'More info' and then 'Run anyways'.

### Useful commands for codebase
Install all dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
update dependencies:
```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

There are (afaik) no packages which are dependent on version, so >= can be used for all requirements. -Anni.
