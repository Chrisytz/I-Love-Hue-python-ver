## Installation Instructions

2. Clone this repository wherever you would like.
3. Find `main.exe`, and double-click to run on windows.

### Useful commands for codebase
Install all dependencies:
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
update dependencies:
```python
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

There are (afaik) no packages which are dependent on version, so >= can be used for all requirements. -Anni.
