        --> rectangles and circles and settings

- Anni swapped number sprite generation from using doubled lists to using a single list.
    > this method is still lengthy so it can be further optimized
- note the distinction between different ID's -> we are currently using LIST_ID as a name for LEVEL_ID or STAGE_ID
    - LIST_ID/LEVEL_ID/STAGE_ID all correspond to the identification of ONE colour palette (eg one square on the left)
    - POS_ID works internal to each stage/list-level and encodes the relative position of a circle/number to each other.
    - There are also changes made to i & j to ensure future compatibility wherein we have to check for i/j against larger grids.

- Anni also updated the way in which level returns data. We no longer use multiple stages of checks, instead we use a
flow through system where each function returns a value which is taken as the global return value after a few stages of return.
    - note 0 = won
           1 = exit with issues
           2 = ?????
           ? = ????? << for future expansion

Immediate TODO for anni:
- Don't auto-win on close level
- Create new data ingest structure for levels and running levels
- Automatic gradient generation?! -> not important

Immediate TODO for chris:
- organize folders
